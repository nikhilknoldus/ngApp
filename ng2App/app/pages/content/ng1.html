<h5>What is Angular Js?</h5>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name="cafe"></ion-icon> <b>This app</b> is focusing on both kind of leaners, one who never learned AngularJs and one who learned AngularJs 1 and want to learn AngularJs 2. We are going from very basics to very advance.<br><br> <b>Lets get started <ion-icon name="outlet"></ion-icon></b><br><br>
    <ion-icon name="flash"></ion-icon> First thing: AngularJS is easy to learn.<br>
    <ion-icon name="flash"></ion-icon> AngularJS extends HTML with new attributes.<br>
    <ion-icon name="flash"></ion-icon> AngularJS is perfect for Single Page Applications (SPAs).<br><br>
AngularJS is an open source web application framework. AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It was originally developed in 2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. Its latest version is 2 (still in beta version & not stable). AngularJS is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.
<br><br>
AngularJS is a powerful JavaScript based development framework to create RICH Internet Application(RIA).
<br>
AngularJS provides developers options to write client side application (using JavaScript) in a clean MVC(Model View Controller) way.<br><br>
<b>A complete client-side solution</b><br><br>

Angular is not a single piece in the overall puzzle of building the client-side of a web application. It handles all of the DOM and AJAX glue code you once wrote by hand and puts it in a well-defined structure.<br><br>
<b>We</b> are learning AngularJs2 so we will talk in AngularJs2 terms, like we won't talk about controller but components. As we are going from basic to advance.
