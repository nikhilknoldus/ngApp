  <h5>SERVICES, HTTP, Dependencies</h5>
  <p>

  We are loading BikeParts data by importing mock file but this isn't a best practice   , There where we need this data we need to import mock file. Now service:<br />

  Services are used to share code across the app.<br />

  So in our <b>bike-part.component.ts</b> file we will use <b>bikeData.service.ts</b> and this file will bring data from mock.ts, let's just start<br />

  I know it's still confusing so far, so for removing this sucking confusion let's get to know what is dependenyInjection.<br />

  A dependency injector is in-charge of knowing how to create and send data.<br />
  <br />
  Let's know by doing it.
